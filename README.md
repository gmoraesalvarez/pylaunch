# pylaunch
Simple barebones (as usual) graphical app launcher for linux made with python2 tk.

Looks for icons in /usr/share/icons and /usr/share/pixmaps for now.

Parses the list from /usr/share/applications

Ongoing development, as everything else.

Put a png file named x.png in the same folder.

Requires python2 modules pillow, tk, imaging-tk, rsvg.

XPM icons can be a problem still, don't know how to work around the issue.
